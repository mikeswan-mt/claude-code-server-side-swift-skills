# Claude Code Skills: Server-Side Swift & Xcode Cloud

Production-ready [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) skills for **server-side Swift development** and **Xcode Cloud CI/CD**. These skills provide domain knowledge, code patterns, and workflows that Claude Code uses to assist you in building Swift backends and automating Apple's CI/CD pipeline.

## What Are Claude Code Skills?

Skills are markdown files that give Claude Code specialized knowledge about specific domains. When you ask Claude Code to help with Vapor routing or Xcode Cloud configuration, these skills provide the patterns, anti-patterns, and best practices it needs to give accurate, production-quality guidance.

## Installation

### Option 1: Clone to User Skills Directory (Global)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/melissa-pereira-deel/claude-code-server-side-swift-skills.git

# Copy skills to your Claude Code skills directory
cp -r claude-code-server-side-swift-skills/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

Skills will be available globally across all your Claude Code sessions.

### Option 2: Clone to Project (Project-Scoped)

```bash
# From your project root
git clone https://github.com/melissa-pereira-deel/claude-code-server-side-swift-skills.git .claude-skills-temp

# Copy to project's .claude/skills/
mkdir -p .claude/skills
cp -r .claude-skills-temp/skills/* .claude/skills/
rm -rf .claude-skills-temp
```

Skills will be available only within that project.

### Option 3: Git Submodule

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/melissa-pereira-deel/claude-code-server-side-swift-skills.git .claude/skills-external
```

### Option 4: npx
You can also use `npx` to install the skills, which is part of Node.js. If not laready installed you can use Howebrew to install it on macOS:

```bash
brew install node
```

On Ubuntu/Debian style Linux OSes you can use:

```bash
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

As long as `npx -v` returns a version you can install both skills with:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/melissa-pereira-deel/claude-code-server-side-swift-skills
```

You will be asked which agents to install for and wether to install for the project, or globally.

## Usage Examples

Once installed, just ask Claude Code naturally:

**Server-Side Swift:**
- *"Create a REST API with Vapor and PostgreSQL"*
- *"Set up JWT authentication for my Swift backend"*
- *"Help me deploy my Vapor app to Fly.io"*
- *"Create shared models between my iOS app and server"*
- *"Should I use Vapor or Hummingbird for my microservice?"*

**Xcode Cloud:**
- *"Set up Xcode Cloud for my iOS app"*
- *"Create ci_scripts for my project"*
- *"My Xcode Cloud build is failing with signing errors"*
- *"Optimize my Xcode Cloud compute hours"*
- *"Configure TestFlight distribution on merge to main"*

## Frameworks & Tools Covered

### Server-Side Swift
- **Vapor 4** — Full-featured web framework with Fluent ORM
- **Hummingbird 2** — Lightweight, pure structured concurrency
- **Fluent** — ORM with PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL support
- **JWT** — Stateless authentication for mobile APIs
- **APNSwift** — Push notifications from server
- **Docker** — Multi-stage builds for production
- **Fly.io / Railway** — Cloud deployment platforms

### Xcode Cloud
- **Workflows** — Build, test, archive, distribute automation
- **ci_scripts/** — Post-clone, pre-build, post-build hooks
- **TestFlight** — Internal and external beta distribution
- **App Store Connect** — Automated submission
- **Test Plans** — Parallel testing, UI tests in CI
- **Code Signing** — Cloud-managed certificates

## Architecture-First Philosophy

These skills are designed with a core principle: **tool selection is an architectural decision, not an arbitrary AI choice.**

Before generating any code, the skills guide Claude Code to validate that server-side Swift is the right technology for your project. This means:

- **Presenting trade-offs honestly** — including when Go, Node.js, or Python might be a better fit
- **Surfacing ecosystem gaps** — like the lack of mature Swift libraries for Kafka, email processing, or Elasticsearch
- **Considering team context** — hiring pool, existing expertise, and long-term maintenance
- **Mapping scenarios to recommendations** — a solo indie dev has different needs than a 20-person enterprise team

Every recommendation in `architecture-decisions.md` is backed by real-world production data:

| Case Study | Migration | Key Results |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Apple** — Password Monitoring Service | Java → Swift | 40% throughput ↑, 50% memory ↓, 85% less code |
| **Cultured Code** — Things Cloud | Python → Swift | 4x faster responses, 3x lower compute cost |

It also includes honest assessments of when server-side Swift is *not* the right choice — because the best tool decision is sometimes "use something else."

## Compatibility

- **Swift**: 5.9+ (Swift 6 concurrency patterns included)
- **Vapor**: 4.89+
- **Hummingbird**: 2.0+
- **Xcode**: 15+ (Xcode Cloud)
- **Claude Code**: Any version with skills support

## Contributing

### Style Guidelines

- Use `kebab-case` for file names
- Include both ✅ good and ❌ bad patterns with explanations
- All Swift code must compile (use realistic, complete examples)
- Keep SKILL.md files under 300 lines; reference files under 600 lines
- Cross-reference related files in the References section
